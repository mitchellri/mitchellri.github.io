					My passion for technology and innovation began in my teens with Sinclair ZX80's, Commodore PETs & Apple ]['s. This kick-started a career in software on DEC PDP-11s and VAXs.

					Coding led to product development, software team management, web development and marketing. And now I am a General Manager enjoying a whole new world of leadership, strategy, finance and HR.

					I am also currently back at school stretching my mind and studying part-time for an MBA.

					Away from the hustle, my other passions include bicycles, technology, coffee, walking, cooking and supercharged Jags.

					The Skinny: I'm Wes Bos, a full stack web developer and designer from Hamilton, Canada. I love to share what I know through my training products, teaching and speaking at conferences. I've been creating on the web for around 9 years and have become pretty good at it. I hang out on Twitter and would love to meet you!

					A little more… I’m super passionate about design, development, and business. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to do all three as a career. From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5.  New and open source web technologies make me super excited and I can’t wait to see what is to come of the web in the next few years.

					If you came here to find out what theme, app or desk chair that I use, check out my uses page.

					I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back. I regularly have speaking events on everything from Front End Dev to ServerSide JavaScript.I’m a lead instructor at HackerYou where we teach full time, part time and single day classes. I’m also part of the amazing Ladies Learning Code where I instruct the WordPress courses.

					I’ve worked for myself my entire life. I’ve graduated of Ryerson University’s Business Technology Management program where I obtained my Bachelor of Commerce in enterprise resource development. Its a fancy way of saying that I really know how technology and business should work together.

					When not creating websites, I love to spend my time with my beautiful girlfriend Fiance wife Kaitlin, my daughters Lux and Poppy, my family and friends. In the summer I rebuild and ride vintage racing bikes. I like to fancy myself as a good cook, I’m obsessed with cast iron cookware, smoking meat on my Big Green Egg and have been known to make some pretty killer pulled pork.

					When I was young, I knew that in addition to being interested in technology, I wanted to do something that had the potential to positively impact the lives of as many people as possible. After realizing this, the things I did growing up, ranging from teaching to choosing Software Engineering as my major, reflected my desire to feed my curiosity for technology and to combine it with my passion for collaborating with others. Throughout my internships and design projects in university, I quickly realized that I enjoyed learning about, and putting myself into the shoes of customers. Working in Thailand I met many new friends eager for help to prepare for their accreditable English exams such as IELTS. After many sessions I found myself in a professional teaching position where I curated and taught English to small groups of children. I quickly realized the importance of placing myself into the shoes of my listeners or users, and enjoyed doing so; this is a concept I incorporate in my all my work to build both products and experiences that delight users.

					While working on team projects, I seek to create a strong group dynamic through facilitating communication and ensuring that all group members are working towards a shared, and mutually agreed upon goal. Throughout my internships and design projects in college, I quickly realized that I enjoyed learning about, and putting myself into the shoes of users; this was something I did then, and still do today to design and build both products and experiences that delight users.

					I'm currently a contractor at TELUS working with the large complex deals team. This role lets me continue the journey I started as a kid by combining my technical knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with my love of building relationships and great experiences with customers and partners.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of work you’ll find me dabbling in far too many hobbies including art, food, photography, reading, fitness/sports, and video game development.
